# SystemOfLinearEquationsSolver
This is a system of linear equations solver which also comes with a GUI. It uses matrices to solve the equations.

# How to use
1. Set the number of variables using the scrollbar in the top.
2. Enter the coeffecients (only integers) of the variables in the corresponding columns. For example, if you have 3 equations: 
  1) 3x + 2y + 4z = 16
  2) 1x + 1y + 2z = 17
  3) 2y + 4z = 10
  Add the coefficents in the manner as shown below:
3. Click Solve! to get the values for x1, x2, x3 (aka x,y,z)
4. Click Reset to reset the board.
